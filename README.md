This repository serves to show work I completed in the NASA L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy during Spring 2021.

### Mission Statement
The BRAVE (Balloon Reconnaissance Atmospheric Venus Exploration) lander is a secondary airborne vehicle to a lander orbiter mission to Venus that specifically focuses on
investigating and collecting data on signs of life and sustainability within the Venusian atmosphere and informing future missions. The purpose of this focus lies in the lack of clear and complete data on the diverse planetary conditions of Venus. Thus, this mission attempts to solve this through surveying and assessing the atmosphereâ€™s internal chemistry, interactions between both solar and thermal radiation fields, temperature, pressure, wind velocities, and solar heating rate through panoramic images captured by a spectroradiometer including the presence of life-sustaining substances (water, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur) to identify regions which promote sustainability and provide detailed insights for computational
modeling and designing of future missions.

*L'SPACE MCA Team 23 PDR.pdf* is the Preliminary Design Review which gives an overview of the mission, its scientific objectives and research, procedures, vehicle designs, payload designs, safety planning, and budgeting.

*L'SPACE_MCA_Certificate.pdf* is the certificate given upon successfully completing the Academy showcasing all skill badges the apprentice achieved in its duration.
